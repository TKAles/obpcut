### A tool for silcing CAD models for the FreeMelt eMelt iD  

This is currently a spare-time, as I can project. Feel free to submit issues, but there is no promise of it getting fixed. Or the software even running for that matter.  

I am not good at git.  

Uses uv for package management, but you can also use pip.
